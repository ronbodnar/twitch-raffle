Twitch Raffle
-------------
Twitch Raffle is a tool that was designed to help streamers manage raffles or giveaways within their
own Twitch chat without the hassle of dealing with the laggy chat environment that comes along with it.

Note: Twitch Raffle is now outdated and may or may not work properly. As it was developed over 9 years ago, Twitch has likely changed their API.


Developers Notice
-----------------
Twitch Raffle is relatively new and was tested on multiple chats during different traffic levels,
meaning that it was extensively tested during both low and high volumes of chat messages. No
issues were found, but if you are to come across something not working properly, please submit
a bug report via the Help menu within the program.
